User Manual: 

You can navigate to index.js file and start configuring your web application. 
Make sure to either delete the queries you do not need or correct them, otherwise application will not run. 
All functions have comments that explain what they do, and where is it necessary to add your configurations.


mapdemo.ejs is the file that includes the Google Maps and polygons, (Note that you will need Google Cloud subscription to include your MAP API link in the code, 
otherwise Map will not load). 
There are infinite different ways to make use of this library, therefore, only necessary functions are included in each file
and every additional behaviour is left to be defined by its developers. 


Source of UK postcode GeoJson files were imported from the following Github repository: https://github.com/missinglink/uk-postcode-polygons
